# ReLove (windows only)
Easily make executables with icons!

## ReLove - How it works

Put ReLove in a (preferably) empty folder

Put in a .love file and maybe a .ico file of your own

Open relove.bat and let it work it's magic

Once it is done, press any key, and open build.zip

## ReLove - Configs

Opening Relove.bat makes Relove.ini - configure it to your taste

ReLove is also under license GNU GPL v3, which allows you to do basically anything BUT make closed source distributions.

This means you can modify the batch file itself to fit exactly what you want
